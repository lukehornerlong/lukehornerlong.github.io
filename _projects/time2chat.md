Time 2 chat is a concept currently in development by me and my friend Kieran. Both of us being people who have struggled with their mental health came up with this idea to try and make a difference for young lads like us.
It's always been an issue as a guy going to friends to talk about the deep and sad stuff so by providing this platform we are giving a means to talk to people without the fear of opening up to those close to you and giving you a outside perspective on your situation

## The concept
- A secure platform for young men to open up annonymously
- Users will input their data when signing up but this will not be visible to any other users
- This information will consist of age, country(e.g. england) and name. User will have to scan in their ID/ passport to make sure they are held accountable, in case bullying occurs
- Users will then just tap a button (time2chat) and they will type in what they want to chat about and select if they want to talk to someone their age or older, it will pair them up with another active user preferably of the requested age and in the same country
- Users can then chat about the topic with the option to leave the chat at any time or report the other user if their discussion is inappropriate
