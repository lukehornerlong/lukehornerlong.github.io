This Project was created as part of my university 'Team Project' module. The module description was:

Team Project teaches Agile Development Practices by doing. This is the most industry-relevant module
you will take. Teams will produce a full-stack web-application, using industry-standard development
techniques (Kanban, CI/CD, code reviews, etc.). Some tasks are submitted individually and peer-assessed
by the team

We all came up with ideas on what to develop into a webapp mine being the idea that was chosen:

### Student Food Shop Reviews

-   App where people can input certain items from a variety of shops (e.g. pulled pork from aldi)

-   They can then review it and say what they made with it upload all the macros etc

-   Help people spot sales in local shops etc

-   Gradually build up a large database of lots of different food items

-   App would then suggest people foods based on their preferences (affordability, taste, halal etc)

-   Acts almost like a social networking tool for students trying to have a healthy but affordable diet

-   Offer discounts in shops as incentive for leaving enough reviews and making posts

We decided on the project 'SCRAN'. This was to be a social media targeted at young people and students to share their simple recipies. As a team we broke the work down into vertical slices. I took the <a href="https://lukehornerlong.live/assets/pdf/s3techreport.pdf" class = "text-link">pantry</a> feature as well as assisting with a lot of the front end development of the project.
I also completed a tech report on the importance of dev ops within the team to confirm a high quality of project.

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
